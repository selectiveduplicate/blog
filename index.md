# Welcome

Hi. I'm Sakib.

I like working with computers, programming languages and software. Sometimes I write horrible code and even worse articles. I have many other interests such as literature, films, anime. My boredom makes me seek out new stuff constantly.

This blog is an attempted digital diary of all those things.
