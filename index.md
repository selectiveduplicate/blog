# Welcome

Hi. I'm Sakib.

I like working with computers. Sometimes I write horrible code and even worse articles. I have a broad and evolving array of interests such as literature, films, anime. My boredom makes me seek out new stuff constantly.

This blog is an attempted digital diary of all those things.
